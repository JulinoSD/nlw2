# nlw2
My participation on the secund edition of Next Level Week gifted by Rocketseat

## what's about that?

NLW is a marathon offered for free to everyone who want to improve he skill on the way 'how their do code'. In this edition and the last, (i have both of then) they focused on the Typescript feture enhancing a App builted with a pieces of Components, improving the way we fetured our code guarented the best scalibility of the App.

  The App we built here call Proffy, you need to try this, is pretty cool.

## Stacks we use here

* `NodeJs`: for backend, add `Express Js version` ;
* `React Js`: for web version, and;
* `React Native Js`: for mobile version.
###### you can check all versions on the package.json, or package-lock.json (if you know how, pay atencion on that)

## How to test or use that repo/App and add some fetures you like?

1. You need to clone this reposotory: beware that you have Git and Github installed on you PC.
2. you need NodeJs (it can with Npm installed) on the PC too.
3. A code editor fits perfectly, to get all tasks complete.

#### Prety code for clone on comand line (cmd)
`$ git clone https://github.com/JulinoSD/nlw2.git`

#### accessing the folder on cmd
`$ cd nlw2`, using `$ cd name` and the name of the folder is the best way to get in on there (cmd).

Acessed the folder and inside of you Code Editor, open `package.json` and take a look at all versions inside the __dependencies__ curly brackets, or **dev dependencies**. Install all of then. _To install if you dont use `VScode` editor, you access the folder on the cmd and run `$ npm install NameOfThePackage`. With `VScode` you have cmd running inside with `PowerShell`, you only need to call it hit `ctrl + '` (on windows for exemple).

**Note that**: to do it well, you need to acess the folder were the App/Code it is.

## And enjoyyyy

Do some pull request to improve, if you don't mind.
